# How it works
This tool is designed to read the names of .mvar map files as they appear in-game for Halo Reach from the Master Chief Collection.
It reads the contents of the file and makes it's best effort to present you the file name in a readable format.

# How to use
Point it towards your "Map" folder inside `C:/Users/{WindowsUsername}/AppData/LocalLow/MCC/LocalFiles/{UserID}/HaloReach/Map`
Clicking "Load Maps" will fetch all the maps from that folder and try it's best to parse the name as it would appear in-game.
If it reads anything as "Unknown Map" and you'd like to fix it, right-click the map and click "Open in Text Editor" it will open in your default text editor, and you can make out the name as such:
<img width="1531" height="747" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/085be49a-61d1-4577-94ae-b7d7a81019b2" />
You can then right-click it again and edit the name, this will be remembered for next time you load the same file.

There's some other features to this program that may also be useful to you, I will write further documentation about this at a later time.
